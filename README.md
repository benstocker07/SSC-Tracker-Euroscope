This repository is relatively straightforward in that it takes traffic from an SSC-Tracker server, converts the .json output to FSD for Euroscope to import as traffic. All normal Euroscope features work with this and traffic work as if you are on the live VATSIM network. 

Requirements:
- Euroscope (Windows / Wine)
- Python (v3.8 +)
- SSC-Tracker (https://ssc-tracker.org)
